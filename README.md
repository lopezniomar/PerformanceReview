# SQL Performance Review Portfolio Project

My SQL portfolio project involves analyzing employee performance review data for Kohler LLC, a fictional company. The project includes two tables: an employee demographics table and a performance score table. Using SQL, I calculated each employee's new salary based on their performance score and analyzed the company's salary budget before and after the performance reviews. Additionally, I examined potential discrimination within the company by analyzing each demographic group's performance score and salary changes to ensure fairness and equality. Overall, my project showcases my proficiency in SQL and my ability to apply it to real-world scenarios.
